# 👋 Hi, I'm Kirill Makarov!

🎮 **Unity Developer | Game Mechanics & Educational Simulations Expert**

I specialize in creating interactive, visually rich, and performance-optimized Unity projects — from logic-based games and puzzle systems to complex educational simulations.

---

## 💡 What I Do:
- 🔎 **Game Design & Mechanics** — Puzzle logic systems, AI-driven behaviors, drag-and-drop interfaces.
- ⚙️ **Performance Optimization** — Addressables, WebGL deployment, AWS & Web3 asset streaming.
- 🎨 **Animation Integration** — 2D animations (Spine), sprite-based effects, and custom shaders.
- 🔗 **API & Data-Driven Systems** — TypeScript APIs, JSON-based dynamic simulation logic.
